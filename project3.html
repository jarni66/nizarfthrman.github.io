    <h1>E-commerce Shop Web Scraping</h1>
        <p>Posted on Feb 17, 2022</p>
        <p>
            This project comes on my mind when i thinking to start a new clothing business. 
            On starting new business i need to research market to have picture how the specific market going.
            There is some way to research market, but i decide to research selling data from competitors, which leads to e-commerce.
            So in this project i scrape data form 2 different e-commerece (Tokopedia and Shopee) on brand called Duha Muslimwear.
            For this project i will get product name, price, and sales, for all product in e-commerce shop.
        </p>

            Some project details
        </h3>
        <p>
            To scrape data from web i use python with library selenium and beautiful soup, then to save the data i use pandas, and last to visual the data i use Tableau.
            Because i need to scrape from 2 different sites, so i separate the scraping and data cleaning process, then i will combine data on visualization process.
            You can access full code for this project in my <a href="https://github.com/jarni66/myProjects/tree/main/ecommerce_scrape" target="_blank">github reporsitory.</a>
