            This project comes from my curiosity for building simple app on android. Started with my hobby playing card game with my friends,
            the came called 'Remi'. The goal in this game is to reach certain score and every match the score need to be write down to track every player score.
            So i decide to build this simple score app for this problem. I realize there is some features need to be add to the app, but it is decent enought to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            This app contains 2 page. First page, for input score for every player. Second page, a graph display for every match.
            First page (Skor page) i use a lot of text field and text controller to get value and then add to the list. The list then dispalyed with
            list view so it can be scrollable, the reason is because the list may longer than screen. Second page (chartpage) i use line chart library
            and extra list for every match score.
        </p>
